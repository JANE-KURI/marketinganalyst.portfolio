Hi, I’m Jane Kuri!

A purpose-driven professional with a strong interest in how technology, sustainability, and business can work hand in hand to shape a better future. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Communication and Development, which helped me build a solid foundation in effective communication and community engagement.

I started my career at Porgera Joint Venture, a major mining company, where I worked as a Project Administrator and Engagement Officer. This role allowed me to apply my communication skills to real-world sustainability challenges, especially within the scope of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). It also sparked a deeper curiosity about how industries can operate more responsibly and inclusively.

That passion led me to pursue a Master’s in Marketing and Analytics at Hult International Business School. There, I explored how emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, can be used to generate meaningful, data-driven insights that support sustainable business strategies. My goal is to bridge the gap between the business, marketing, and mining sectors, combining analytics with CSR to design innovative solutions that have long-term impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling and learning from different cultures, which helps me stay curious, open-minded, and ready to collaborate on ideas that drive both social and business progress.
